Enemies in a list
for e in enemylist
    if coordinates enemy == coordinates player
        lose & home screen!?


How can we visualise enemies/player? is it possible to use sprites or only shapes?
look at java.awt.Graphics documentation what other things can be drawn/created (then implement in consoleview.paint)


how can we build walls and prevent collision?
i think we should have a static map and not a randomly generated, no need to overdo it.
walls as lines in console view and as rectangles in graphicsview?! i think we should resize the game board for sure @Labyrinth.main.new Runnable.run heigth / width, 10x10 is small and we can aslo scale up the window size of the graphics view @Labyrinth....run fieldDimension in the fieldDimensions constructor
